There were remains of a 4-year-old boy found there, who allegedly died while they were performing some sort of Islamic ritual over him. The Bundys and their supporters got nearly two years in jail and no one hurt a single person! Shame on those who are supposed to uphold law and justice! Shame! Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe testified that they found children holding boxes of ammunition, and that one child was found with a gun…. Because sharia trumps dead children, school shooting training, kidnapping and jihad training. The children discovered at an “extremist Muslim” compound in New Mexico earlier this month were both trained to use firearms and taught multiple tactical techniques in order to kill teachers, law enforcement and other institution…. state prosecutors said on Monday. take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

It is the tool in which the ummah enforces sharia blasphemy laws in the West. Waco – the Feds killed ’em all. Shot it up and burned it down. Fast forward to Islam in America — New Mexico compound jihadis released on bond after charges of racism and “Islamophobia” “THEIR LAWYER ARGUED THAT THERE WAS A DOUBLE STANDARD IN THE CASE BECAUSE HIS CLIENTS WERE MUSLIMS. HE ARGUED THAT IF THEY HAD BEEN CHRISTIAN AND WHITE, ‘WE MIGHT NOT BE HERE TODAY.’” Bu Jihad Watch, August 13, 2018: Seriously? If they had been Christian and white, stockpiling weapons and plotting school shootings, with the ringleader being the son of one of the most respected Christian preachers in the country, there wouldn’t have been news coverage of anything else for weeks. There would have been feature stories in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal. CNN and MSNBC would be running special reports on toxic Christianity and the crisis in the churches. This incident, on the other hand, received very little coverage, and hardly any that touched on the Islamic aspects of the story. But Muslim claims of victimhood are so polished and reflexive by now, and the Leftist acceptance of them so matter-of-fact and instinctive, that Judge Sarah Backus fell right into line. We can only hope that no one dies because of her folly. “Breaking: Judge makes stunning decision in Muslim compound case after charges of racism,” by Carlos Garcia, The Blaze, August 13, 2018 (thanks to Robert): In a hearing Monday, a New Mexico judge found that suspects in a bizarre child abuse case were not a danger to the public, and released them on bond. Defense attorney blames Islamophobia Two Muslim men and three women are charged with 11 counts of child abuse each after police raided their compound in New Mexico and discovered 11 malnourished children living in squalor. Their lawyer argued that there was a double standard in the case because his clients were Muslims. He argued that if they had been Christian and white, “we might not be here today.” Despite law enforcement authorities saying that they believe that the children were being trained to attack innocents, and that the adults were radicalized, Judge Sarah Backus released the suspects. Prosecutors also said they obtained a letter from one of the suspects telling his brother to come to the compound and die like a martyr. The lawyer for the suspects said that there was no evidence that they were planning any kind of attacks.

       " \"Warrants Show Police Never Searched Amber Guyger’s Apartment, Now It’s Too Late, She’s ‘Vacated’ It  Dallas, TX — On Sunday, activists rallied around the Dallas Cowboy’s stadium to draw attention to the slaying of Botham Jean. They carried coffins and blocked traffic to expose the special treatment of Amber Guyger, the cop who has yet to even be fired for killing Jean. Now, as more details emerge, this special treatment has moved to a level that is even more insidious.

Completing this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. From the beginning of this case, it was clear that Guyger was receiving special treatment from law enforcement. One of the most glaring instances showing her privilege was the fact that the Texas Rangers said in their report that Jean refused to obey Guyger’s “verbal commands.” Had anyone else but a cop walked into an apartment and killed an innocent man, do you believe that investigators would have said anything like this? Attorney Stephen Le Brocq, who operates a law firm in the North Texas area sums up the treatment of Guyger perfectly when he says that “The affidavit isn’t written objectively, not at the slightest. As stated before, they are usually wholly against the accused. An objective view of the information related by the officer would be proper, in my opinion. This affidavit states facts based upon the word of the person it seeks to accuse of criminal wrongdoing.” What’s more, according to WFAA, who obtained affidavits for all of the search warrants involved in the case, none of them involved the search of Guyger’s apartment. For those who don’t recall, police egregiously released the search warrant findings of Jean’s apartment on the day his family buried his dead body. They attempted to assassinate Jean’s character by claiming they found less than a half ounce of weed in his apartment. However, they failed miserably at it. One thing in particular, however, stood out to those paying attention and that is the fact the police didn’t release any information on what they found in Guyger’s apartment. According to the information currently available, that’s because they didn’t search it. According to WFAA, there were five search warrants issued in the case—none of which were for the killer’s apartment. As WFAA reports: Two of the warrants allowed investigators to remove the front door of Guyger and Jean’s apartment, their door locks and to download data for their door locks. An inventory return states that they removed both of their door lock and downloaded the data from the door locks. A third search warrant gave investigators the authority to enter Jean’s apartment and collect additional evidence. A return shows that investigators took photographs of his apartment, made videos of his apartment, conducted “laser measurements of firearm trajectory,” and collected “gunshot residue” from the door frame and kitchen wall of Jean’s apartment. A return for the fourth search warrant shows investigators seized video from the surveillance camera system in the apartment management’s office. A fifth search warrant gave investigators the authority to obtain all communications related to the incident in the possession of property management, as well as all surveillance video and all entry and access logs from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. on the night of the shooting. An inventory return shows investigators seized a USB drive containing the video, an event log report for “linear access doors and gates,” an “elevator access door lock” report and a “lock audit report for both apartments. Now, even if police would try to search the killer cop’s apartment, it’s too late. On Sunday, apartment staff notified residents in an email that Guyger “has vacated her apartment and no longer resides at our community.” A manager at the complex declined to indicate exactly when Guyger moved out and if she left the premises voluntarily, the Dallas Morning News reports. While residents can certainly sleep better knowing that they don’t have to fear a killer cop walking into their apartment and murdering them, the family of Botham Jean likely sees this as one more instance of injustice. Mother of #BothamJean, Allison Jean, says the “smear” of her son is unacceptable. “It is time that we recognize that lives matter, my son’s life matters.” pic.twitter.com/UjyKRZ8XeG — Jack Highberger (@JackHighberger) September 14, 2018 Article posted with permission from The Free Thought Project \")"
